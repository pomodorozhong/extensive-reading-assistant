# Extensive Reading Assistant

A tool that generates personalized reading materials to support extensive reading practice based on user interests and reading level.

## What is Extensive Reading?

Extensive reading (ER) is an approach to reading where learners read large quantities of easy, enjoyable texts without focusing on detailed analysis or translation. The key principles include:

- Reading material should be easy and well within the reader's current level
- Readers choose what they want to read based on their interests
- Reading is done for pleasure and general understanding
- Reading speed is typically faster since the material is easily understood

The core philosophy is "we learn to read by reading" - extensive exposure to comprehensible text helps develop reading fluency and language skills naturally.
